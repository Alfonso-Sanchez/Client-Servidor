# Client-Server Practice

## Overview

This code implements a client-server application. It features a server that performs mathematical operations requested by the client. Additionally, the server is designed to support multiple clients simultaneously.

## Requirements

To run this application, you will need the following:

*   A configured Linux environment.
*   C and GCC installed with default settings.
*   Compilation of `client.c`: `gcc client_esquelet.c -o client`
*   Compilation of `server.c`: `gcc servidor_esquelet.c -o servidor -lm` (This requires the linker to synchronize the `MATH.H` library.)

## Authors

*   Eduard Vericat Batalla
*   Alfonso Sanchez Ferrer
